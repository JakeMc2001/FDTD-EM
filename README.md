# FDTD EM Propagation
This is a collection of my implementation of code from ['Understanding the FDTD Method' by John. B Schneider](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/ufdtd/).

## Background
Initially, I implemented this code into Swift in a group project during my 1st year as a physics student. Now, while working on my skills as a software developer, I'm re-coding this project into Python, due to the easier graphing functionality.

# Programs:

## 1DbareBones.py - Program 3.1:
This is the first EM propagation program in the book, Program 3.1, showing the propagation of an EM wave through free space across a grid of size 200.
