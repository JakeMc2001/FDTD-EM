# FDTD EM Propagation
This is a collection of my implementation of code from ['Understanding the FDTD Method' by John. B Schneider](https://eecs.wsu.edu/~schneidj/ufdtd/).

## Background
Initially, I implemented this code into Swift in a group project during my 1st year as a physics student. Now, while working on my skills as a software developer, I'm re-coding this project into Python, due to the easier graphing functionality.
